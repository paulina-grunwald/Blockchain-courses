### Installing GETH Etherum
GETH Ethereum can be download on [Go Etherum website](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/). You need to select correct version for your operting system.

###Working with GETH
In order to start up geth open PowerShell(on windows) and type comamnd __geth__. The first time you start geth it will run in the __fast mode__ (it will download all the block and only about last 1024 transactions). By running geth you will join etherum netowrk and be able to do following:
- mine real etherum,
- transfer funds between addresses,
- create contracts and send transactions,
- explore blocks history
etc.

There are three interfaces for using geth:
  - __Javascript Console__: geth can be launched with an interactive console, that provides a javascript runtime environment exposing a javascript API to interact with your node. Javascript Console API includes the web3 javascript √êapp API as well as an additional admin API.
  - __JSON-RPC server__: geth can be launched with a json-rpc server that exposes the JSON-RPC API
  - __Command line options__ documents command line parameters as well as subcommands
